# moseq2-viz
Visualization toolbox for MoSeq2

so you need somewhere in your directory (will search recursively), `pca_scores.h5` and the `results.h5` files

`pca_sores.h5` actually you specify via `moseq2-viz generate-index --pca-file _pca/pca_scores.h5`, e.g.
that stores the path to everything you need
then `moseq2-viz make-crowd-movies moseq2-index.yaml testing.p` if `testing.p` contains a model fit

All documentation regarding moseq2-model can be found in the `Documentation.pdf` file in the root directory.
